Purpose:        Working with an existing student auditing program.
                Modify the student auditing program to interact with a Fa√ßade class
                that acts as an interface to a simulated cloud-based storage service.
                also implement a class template and overloaded operators.

                //to test the program

                valgrind ./a4 <in.txt
                //For testing: using in.txt to test the program.
                //using valgrind to test the memory leak

                make clean
                //to clean the object files, executables.

Launching:
